# Optical Sensor Transfer Channel

For testing this application you will need two computers (or at least one computer and one tablet).

Encoder:
Run the encoder application by opening the "encoder.html" file in the browser, then choose the pattern and enter the binary stream then hit the enter.
Note: You have to put the optical mouse which is connected to the other computer (the Decoder computer) on the pattern area in the Encoder computer's screen

Decoder:
Just open the file "decoder.html" on the Decoder computer (other than encoder's computer) and see what will happened to decode the message.


If you are willing to modify the algorithms feel free to create a branch and rewrite the encoding and decoding algorthims
